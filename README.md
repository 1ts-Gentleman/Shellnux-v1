It helps players learn Linux commands and terminal skills by solving progressively harder shell-based challenges.

## 🕹️ How to Play

Each level presents you with a shell environment and a specific goal (e.g., find a password, read a file, escape a folder, etc.). Use your command-line knowledge to progress.

> 💡 It's a great way to practice `cd`, `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `chmod`, pipes, redirection, and more.
